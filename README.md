## These are my learnyounode solutions

Trying to get a node refresher, I know some of these methods are a bit outdated, but I feel like I'm getting my sea legs again. Last time I did these it took me a lot longer to understand callbacks. Looking forward to looking more into promises and async/await, the whole node event loop in general.

Interested in trying out the problems yourself? Check out learn you node at [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) on github.

Or run `npm install -g learnyounode` and get started!
